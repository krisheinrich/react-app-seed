# react-app-seed

## Getting Started

This project provides a bare-bones boilerplate for creating React.js web applications. Included are several common useful npm packages as well as a basic file structure organized with component modularity in mind. The basic React data flow is set up as well; all that remains is for the developer to implement any components relevant to a new project.

## Running the Demo page

1. Fork the project, then install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the start script to compile the JSX to JS: `npm start`
3. Load the `public/index.html` file in your favorite browser for a (personally biased) message.

## Included Node packages

* babelify
* babel-preset-react
* react
* react-dom
* watchify
